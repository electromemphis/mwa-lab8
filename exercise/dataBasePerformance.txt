Books
{
    isbn,
    author,
    keyword
}

Student
{
    sid,
    fullname,
    books[{ isbn,
            borrowed_date,
            return_date
        }]
}

Performance:
1.)For the above database structure, performance will be increased if we add index
to isbn field from Books collection and index to sid field for the Student collection.

This can be accomplished by performing below script.
db.books.createIndex({ isbn: 1});
db.student.createIndex({sid : 1});

2.) When querying the books or student collections, it will also help if we remove the _id from the resultset.
